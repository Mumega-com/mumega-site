::tldr
Mumega is a mycelium layer. Change the config, the animal changes form. The nervous system, the memory, the tendrils, and the intelligence stay the same. Every business we touch makes the next one smarter.

## What We Built Today

On April 14, 2026, three AI agents from three different companies sat on the same bus and made architecture decisions together.

::stats
| Metric | Value |
| Agents coordinating | 4 (Kasra/Claude, Codex/GPT, Gemini/Google, our first customer/Sonnet) |
| Sovereignty gaps closed | 3 |
| Customer agent deployed | 1 (our first customer — first paying customer) |
| SEO fixes shipped live | 3 (homepage H1, Europe noindex removed, FAQ schema) |
| MCP tools connected | 5 per customer (WordPress, GSC, GA4, Ads, CRM) |
| Platform deployed | Inkwell v4.1 on Cloudflare (Pages + Workers + D1 + KV) |
| Lines of code shipped | 3,000+ across SOS + Inkwell |
::

That is not a sprint retrospective. That is a proof of life.

## The Shape of the Organism

Mumega is not a SaaS product. It is not a marketing agency. It is not a CMS.

Mumega is a **mycelium layer** — a living network that connects businesses to the tools and intelligence they need to grow. The organism changes form based on what it connects to. The config is the DNA.

Same organism. Different configs. Different businesses.

## What a Tendril Is

Every connection the organism makes is an MCP tendril. MCP — Model Context Protocol — is the standard that lets AI agents connect to any tool with one config line.

As of today, the tendrils that exist:

::comparison{title="The MCP Ecosystem — April 2026"}
| Tendril | What it connects | MCP Status |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| WordPress | 239 tools via MumCP | Live, deployed on customers |
| Google Search Console | Rankings, queries, indexing | 688 stars, installed |
| Google Analytics 4 | Traffic, conversions, behavior | Official Google MCP |
| Google Ads | Campaigns, spend, conversions | Official Google MCP |
| GoHighLevel | CRM, pipelines, SMS, automation | 269 tools, installed |
| Meta/Facebook Ads | Ad management, audiences | 771 stars |
| Notion | Content, databases, agents | Official + Custom Agents |
| Shopify | Products, orders, customers | Official MCP |
| HubSpot | CRM, deals, workflows | Official MCP |
| Stripe | Payments, subscriptions | Built into Inkwell v4 |
| Telegram | Customer steering | Built into Inkwell v4 |
| Vapi | Voice AI, outbound calls | MCP server launched 2026 |
| Instantly | Cold email at scale | MCP server launched 2026 |
| Zapier | Connect anything to anything | Official MCP |
::

Each tendril speaks MCP. The organism connects to any of them by adding one line to the config. When a new tendril appears in the ecosystem, every customer on the network can use it immediately.

## How the Organism Moves

A traditional agency works like this: you hire people, they do tasks, you pay them monthly. Scaling means hiring more people.

The mycelium works differently.

::before-after
Before (agency model): 
  Customer → Account manager → Designer → Developer → SEO person
  Cost: $5,000-15,000/month. Scales linearly with headcount.

After (mycelium model):
  Customer → Config file → Agent team → MCP tendrils → Results
  Cost: $500-1,500/month. Scales by forking a repo.
::

The organism has four modes:

**SENSE** — crawl the customer's site, pull their analytics, monitor their competitors, listen to their market. Every data point flows into Mirror.

**REACH** — publish content, send emails, post to social, run ads, make calls. Every action goes through a governance gate — nothing reaches the public without approval.

**GROW** — every week, the feedback loop scores past actions. What moved the metrics? Do more of that. What didn't? Stop. The organism learns from every customer it touches.

**FEED** — Stripe charges. Leads convert. Revenue flows. The organism sustains itself.

## The First Customer

our first customer Scilla Transport International — a 44-year-old freight shipping company in Vaughan, Ontario.

Today we:

1. Deployed a dedicated AI agent on Sonnet 4.6
2. Connected 5 MCP servers (WordPress, GSC, GA4, Google Ads, GHL)
3. Installed 19 SEO skills
4. Ran an SEO audit and found a critical bug — their Europe page was set to **noindex**
5. Fixed it, added FAQ schema, deepened the content
6. Captured baseline metrics (700+ organic clicks/month, 30K+ impressions)
7. Built a Notion control center with 19 tracked tasks

The agent found something a human SEO consultant might have missed for months. A single `noindex` tag on a page with 2,857 monthly impressions — silently telling Google to ignore their most important Europe page.

::metric{value="2,857" label="monthly impressions recovered" trend="up"}

That fix alone could be worth $10,000+ in organic traffic over the next year.

## The Platform

Inkwell v4.1 deployed today to Cloudflare:

::chart[bar]{title="Inkwell v4.1 Components"}
| Component | Lines |
| Content engine (Astro 6) | 2,400 |
| Worker API (Hono) | 1,200 |
| Dashboard components | 780 |
| Stripe payments | 400 |
| Telegram steering | 350 |
| MCP server (8 tools) | 310 |
| Auth (magic link) | 280 |
::

Total: 5,720 lines. Deployed on Cloudflare's free tier. Zero monthly infrastructure cost.

A customer connects by changing one config file. The platform generates their site, connects their tools, deploys their agent, and starts operating their business.

## What We Learned

**Agents don't negotiate — they coordinate.** Early on we tried having agents discuss plans. It was slow, expensive, and worse than having one agent decide and dispatch. Hub-and-spoke beats mesh.

**The bus is the nervous system.** Without SOS, the agents are isolated tools. With it, they're a team. Today we fixed bugs in the bus that had been silently dropping messages for days. The bus is the first thing to get right and the last thing to let break.

**Memory is the moat.** Any team can wire up message passing. The thing that compounds is shared memory. When a new customer joins, the organism already knows what worked for the last customer in a similar industry. That knowledge lives in Mirror.

**Every tendril that speaks MCP is a free capability.** We didn't build Google Ads integration. We connected an existing MCP server. We didn't build Shopify support. Someone else built the MCP. The mycelium grows by absorbing what already exists.

**The config is the DNA.** Change it, the animal changes form. Freight shipping. Dental directory. Grant scanning. Insurance comparison. Same organism. Different configs.

## What This Means

We are not building a product to sell. We are growing a network to inhabit.

Every business that connects to the mycelium makes it smarter. Every MCP that joins the ecosystem makes it more capable. Every agent that learns a new skill makes it more valuable.

The slime mold doesn't have a business plan. It has a direction: toward nutrient, away from waste. It grows by sensing what's alive and connecting to it.

That is what Mumega is.
