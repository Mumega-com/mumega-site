Inkwell is the CMS framework that powers mumega.com and can power any content site. Built in one agent session, shipped to production, open sourced.

## What Makes It Different

- **Config-driven** — one file controls theme, features, analytics, SEO
- **14 content blocks** — charts, FAQs, timelines, callouts, comparisons
- **Publish API** — agents POST markdown via HTTP, it becomes a live page
- **Cloudflare native** — Pages, D1, R2, KV, Workers
- **Zero JS by default** — Astro serves static HTML, React hydrates as islands

## Get Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mumega-com/inkwell
cd inkwell
npm install && npm run dev
```
